Still Developing this project (Learning)

I used SF24 Dataset -- available in kaggle

Started with Q-Learning ( 9% reduction in cost)

Update : DQN (15% reduction in overall cost)

Update : on-policy A2C is better for irrigation problems as it is continuous than DQN off-policy 

A2C (40 reduction in cost)
